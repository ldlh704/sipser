\begin{enumerate}[8.1]
  \item Any language in $SPACE(f(n))$ as defined using the two-tape read-only model can be simulated with a single tape model using at most $O(n)$ space. Similarly, any language in $SPACE(f(n))$ as defined using a single tape model can be simulated with a two-tape read-only model with an improvement of a most $O(n)$ space. Thus, the complexity classes are equivalent where $f(n) \geq n$. 
  \item The winning strategy for $X$ is to move to the top-right position. $O$ can then move to block only either the top-centre or centre-right position. If $O$ moves to the top-centre, $X$ moves to the centre-right. If $O$ move to the centre-right, $X$ moves to the top-centre.
