\begin{enumerate}[8.1]
  \item Any language in $SPACE(f(n))$ as defined using the two-tape read-only model can be simulated with a single tape model using at most $O(n)$ space. Similarly, any language in $SPACE(f(n))$ as defined using a single tape model can be simulated with a two-tape read-only model with an improvement of a most $O(n)$ space. Thus, the complexity classes are equivalent where $f(n) \geq n$.
  \item The winning strategy for $X$ is to move to the top-right position. $O$ can then move to block only either the top-centre or centre-right position. If $O$ moves to the top-centre, $X$ moves to the centre-right. If $O$ move to the centre-right, $X$ moves to the top-centre.
  \item Player I has a winning strategy as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Player I begins at node 1.
    \item Player 2 chooses node 2.
    \item Player I chooses node 4. Node 3 has only one outgoing edge which connects to node 6. As node 6 has no outgoing edges, this path would guarantee a win for Player II.
    \item Player II chooses node 5.
    \item Player I chooses node 6. As no unchosen nodes remain, Player I wins.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Let $L_i$ be a language decided by PSPACE turing machine $M_i$. We define languages $L_\cup &= L_i \cup L_j$, $\bar{L_i} &= \{ w \mid w \notin L_i \}$, $L_i^* &= \{ x_1x_2 \hdots x_k$ \mid k \geq 0 \text{ and each } x_i \in L_i \}$.\\\\
    We define $M_\cup$, $\bar{M_i}$ and $M_i^*$ as follows: \\\\
    $M_\cup$ = ``On input $w$
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item Run $M_i\langle w \rangle$. If $M_i$ accepts, $accept$.
      \item Run $M_j\langle w \rangle$. If $M_j$ accepts, $accept$.
      \item If neither $M_i\langle w \rangle$, $M_j\langle w \rangle$ accepted, $reject$.''  \\
    \end{enumerate}
    $\bar{M_i}$ = ``On input $w$
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item Run $M_i\langle w \rangle$. If $M_i$ accepts, $reject$, else $accept$.'' \\
    \end{enumerate}
    $M_i^*$ = ``On input $w$
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item If $w = \epsilon$, $accept$.
      \item For each $m$, where $1 \leq m \leq n$, $n = |w|$.
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item[3.] Split $w$ into $m$ pieces, such that $w = w_1w_2 \hdots w_k$.
        \item[4.] For all $i$, $1 \leq i \leq m$, run $M_i\langle w_i \rangle$. If $M_i$ rejects, go to step 2.
        \item[5.] $M_i$ has accepted for all $i$, $accept$.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item[6.] $M_i$ has rejected for all $m$, $reject$.'' \\
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Construct a TM $M$ to decide $A_\text{DFA}$ When $M$ receives input $\langle A, w \rangle$, a DFA and a string, $M$ simulates $A$ on $w$ by keeping track of $A$'s current state and its current head locations, and updating them appropriately. The space required to carry out this simulation is $O(\log{n})$ because $M$ can record each of these values by storing a pointer into its input.
  \item Construct a language $L$, such that $L$ is PSPACE-hard. As $L$ is PSPACE-hard, $\text{TQBF} \leq_p L$. We know $\text{SAT} \leq_p TQBF$, which gives us $\text{SAT} \leq_p L$. As SAT is NP-complete, $L$ is NP-hard, and the proof is complete.
